# SebaUtils

WARNING: THIS CODE IS WRITTEN ASSUMING THAT SEBAUTILSADV IS INSTALLED ALONGSIDE, IF NOT THEN ISSUES WILL RISE.

SebaUtils has been written as a Server Management tool for our servers.
It is not a mod, it is an MC Datapack written with 1.14.4 as the base version.

The code is not entirely friendly for other servers, as has been written especially for Seba's Server.

If you have any questions, do not hesitate to contact me on Discord.
