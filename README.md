# SebaUtils

WARNING: THIS CODE IS WRITTEN ASSUMING THAT SEBAUTILSADV (https://github.com/Sebastian54/sebautilsadv) IS INSTALLED ALONGSIDE, IF NOT THEN ISSUES WILL RISE.

SebaUtils has been written as a Server Management tool for our servers.
It is not a mod, it is an MC Datapack written with 1.14.4 as the base version.

The code is not entirely friendly for other servers, as has been written especially for Seba's Server.

This also has a API sort of thing, where it tracks how many players are on the server, this is counted as the scoreboard 'PlayerCount'. It also tracks which dimension they are in, this is counted as the scoreboard 'dimension'.

If you have any questions, do not hesitate to contact me on Discord. Sebastian#6789
